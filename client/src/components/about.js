            <p>
                Tender is a great app that helps connect parents and guardians with skilled babysitters in
                their area.

                We're still very much working out the specifics of that but when we've got that all sorted this
                section will tell you in detail here. Broadly speaking you can create a Parent or Sitter account (you
                can also make multiple accounts if you want to fulfill either role). If you are signed into your Parent
                account, you can view sitters in the area, their experience, info, and ratings. You can also post
                Sitting requests, telling potential Sitters the date & time they'll be needed, any special and/or
                requests, and the compensation they can expect. Sitters will be able to view any Sitting requests,
                as well as accessing the basic Parent info from those requests. If a Sitter is interested in fulfilling
                the request, they can contact the parent. If both sides agree, they can Match up. Both Parents and
                Sitters can rate each other as well.
